Programs that represent a reduced state space of programs from the seq-mthreaded folder.
These programs were generated by various reducer-components as proposed by the reducer-based construction of 
conditional model checkers [1]. These components get the original program from seq-mthreaded plus a condition 
produced by CPAchecker after running either a predicate or value analysis for 100 s. Condition and original program 
are used by the reducer-components to output a (residual) program that encodes the state space of the original 
program that has not been verified within 100 s.
