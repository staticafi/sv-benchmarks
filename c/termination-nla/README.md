The benchmarks in this directory were submitted by 
Ton Chanh Le (letonchanh@gmail.com).

These programs contain nonlinear polynomial properties 
(mostly equalities) that are challenging for proving their termination and non-termination.

These programs were adapted from the SV-COMP `nla-digbench` benchmark and have been used in the DynamiTe work:
