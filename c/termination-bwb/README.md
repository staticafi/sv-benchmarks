The benchmarks in this directory were submitted by Yuandong Cyrus Liu(yliu195@stevens.edu).

C programs with bitvector operations for termination analysis with bitwise braching, part of practical code snippets adopted from 
[bithacks optimization](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html), these benchmarks were used in the `DarkSea` work:
