These benchmarks were originally used in the paper

Vijay D'Silva, Leopold Haller, Daniel Kroening, Michael Tautschnig:
Numeric Bounds Analysis with Conflict-Driven Learning. TACAS 2012

The basic benchmarks are

sine - A taylor expansion of a sine function
square - A taylor expansion of a square root 
newton - Newton approximation of sine

where each of them comes with 8 different interval bounds. The Newton
approximation furthermore varies from 1 to 3 iterations. All .i files were
generated from the .c files using suitable values for the NR and ITERATIONS
preprocessor defines.
